# Version 2.0 - Bedazzling Beryl

## What's Changed

### Infrastructure
* #6 - Moved kumi.hpp to tuple/kumi.hpp

This is a slightly API breaking change but as the library gains traction, I hanged the file to a
less surprising name.

### Bug Fixes
* #12 - Make == and != SFINAE friendly

### New Features
* #4 - Add map_index
* #5 - Implements pop/push-front/back
* Implement as_flat_ptr to work with tuple as a list of member's pointers
* #7 - `kumi::tuple` supports min and max
