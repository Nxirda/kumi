  - Add support for `std::invoke`-like calls in `apply`, contributed  by **jehelset**.
  - Add `std::array` as a product type, contributed  by **jehelset**.
  - Allow for automatic std adaptation to be disengaged via macro.

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix #55 - Shortcut to pure fold expression whenever possible in reduction.
  - Fix #64 - Adapt kumi::tuple to std::common_reference.
  - Fix #69 - Better apply and for_each SFINAE compliance.
  - Fix #70 - Sign issue with iota.
  - Fix #71 - Support for eductions without init values.
  - Fix #77 - Adjust type computation of cat, contributed by **jehelset**.
  - Fix as_tuple to work with non-product type value type.
  - Fix predicates to work with non-product type.
  - Fix sign issue with count.
  - Fix SFINAE compliance of comparisons operator when used on tuples with non-comparables elements.

# Version 2.0 - Bedazzling Beryl

## What's Changed

### Infrastructure
* #6 - Moved kumi.hpp to tuple/kumi.hpp

This is a slightly API breaking change but as the library gains traction, I hanged the file to a
less surprising name.

### Bug Fixes
* #12 - Make == and != SFINAE friendly

### New Features
* #4 - Add map_index
* #5 - Implements pop/push-front/back
* Implement as_flat_ptr to work with tuple as a list of member's pointers
* #7 - `kumi::tuple` supports min and max
