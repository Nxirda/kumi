# KUMI - C++20 Compact Tuple Tools

## Summary

**KUMI** is a fancy C++20 implementation of a tuple-like class. It tries to be as close to `std::tuple` as possible but also wants to compile faster, uses a better C++20 oriented interface, and new features for manipulating, rebuilding, or accessing tuples and sub-tuples to improve quality of life.
